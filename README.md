# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# App Eventos IFSP

Este projeto utiliza [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) e foi inicializado com [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Além disso, utiliza componentes do [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev/).

## Instalação

1. Clone o repositório:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/app-eventos-IFSP.git
    cd app-eventos-IFSP
    ```

2. Instale as dependências:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # ou
    yarn install
    # ou
    pnpm install
    ```

## Rodando o Servidor de Desenvolvimento

Inicie o servidor de desenvolvimento com o comando:

```bash
npm run dev
# ou
yarn dev
# ou
pnpm dev
```

Abra [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) no navegador para visualizar o projeto.

## Configurando e Instalando o ShadCN/UI

Este projeto utiliza o [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.dev/) para componentes estilizados. Para instalar e configurar novos componentes:

1. Instale o CLI do shadcn:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn add
    ```

2. Adicione componentes ao projeto:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn add button
    npx shadcn add card
    # Substitua "button" e "card" pelos componentes que deseja adicionar
    ```

3. Certifique-se de que as dependências necessárias para os componentes foram instaladas. Consulte a [documentação oficial](https://ui.shadcn.dev/docs/installation) para mais detalhes.

## Estrutura do Projeto

Você pode começar a editar a aplicação modificando o arquivo `app/page.js`. As alterações serão refletidas automaticamente no navegador.
